## Showcasing Scraped Data
The scraped data, in the form of XML, can be loaded into the site included in this repository. The site, which I have coded for this purpose, allows you to read the XML data and interact with it. Specifically, you can save the data into a MySQL database along with a title and description.

### Steps to Showcase Scraped Data
1. **Load XML Data:** Visit the provided site in the repository.
2. **Read XML Data:** Use the site's functionality to read and explore the contents of the XML data.
3. **Save to MySQL Database:** Utilize the site's features to save selected data along with a title and description to a MySQL database.
